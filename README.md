# Notes Management System (Java – Console Based)

## 📌 Overview
The Notes Management System is a simple, efficient, and lightweight console-based Java application designed to allow users to create, edit, delete, search, categorize, and manage text-based notes.  
This project demonstrates core concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, data persistence, modular design, and clean coding practices.
